- seperate `ghostos` from its subcommands
  - like how it's `git commit`, not `git-commit`
    - this means if someone types `ghostos builb`, it can give a help message
    - rather than giving a vauge error because `ghostos-builb` isn't defined
    - this also means `ghost-os build` giving a "command not found" error tacitly means that ghost-os isn't the correct way to spell it
  - semi-modular
- man page
  - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man-pages.7.html
  - could be section 4 if considered a device or driver
